L-comp 8
Answer:
printf("%9.5f\n%10c",d,c);

L-comp 9
Answer:
They are of the same size because they are both adresses.

L-comp 10
Answer:
Since the 4 byte int is unsigned, its valaues will range 0...2^32-1 which is
equal to 0...4294967295. To get to the limit of the range of our int we can
multiply 429496729.5 by 10. Since 429496729.5 is not an integer, the smallest 
value that will result in integer overflow is thus number rounded up,
which is 429496730

L-comp 11
Answer:

(1) ratio=number/denom contains no typecasts because the user doesn't specify any,
and the program would not be inclined to use any because both numer and denom
are already of the same type (int).
(2) ratio=number/((double) denom) has an EXPLICIT typecast on denom, but also
and IMPLICIT typecast on number, since the program wants number and denom 
to be of the same type.
(3) ratio=((double) numer)/((double)denom) is EXPLICIT, since we use (double)
on both numer and denom.

L-comp 12
Answer:
Global variables work against modularity because they allow one function affect
another and thus the functions within the program are not seperately defined.

L-comp 13
Answer:
A function prototype is useful when one is trying to call functions that have not
yet been fully defined or are defined after they have been called.

L-comp 14
Answer:
Preprocessor commands are recognized by starting a line with #. Some of these incude:
#include <.h file> where the preprocessor will replace this line with all the function
protypes included in it.
#define var_name value where the preprocessor will replace every occurance of
var_name in the code with value. In much the same way we can use define to 
write short commands, such as #define f(x) (x^2) which is called a macro,
and will replace every occurance of f(x) with x^2.

L-comp 15
Answer:
It acesses the element inv0 in the struct named inv.

L-comp 16
Answer:
True = any number that isn't 0
False = 0
